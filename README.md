## As of 4.29: 
- I made changes to the website after talking to Roger, the course instructor, including adding .html to the pages and .css and .js to other pages.  
- Moving forward, I would like to keep the .css in one page and if possible keep the .js in one page.
- I want to add '<border>' to the various elements to make it look more presentable.  I also want to, generally, make the website look better.  
- I would also like to add three or more dynamic functions to the website. 
## As of 4.30:
[x] Dynamic elements 
[x] added borders
[x] the website looks better than yesterday, in my opinion
- what else can I work on?
